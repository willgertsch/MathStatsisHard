      <description>I took a course in generalized linear models in my first year of graduate school, but I was never happy with the organization of the material in our lecture slides or in the books I have read on the subject. I feel that introducing the general theory as early as possible is helpful in understanding the many, many models that come up in a a course on GLMs. Therefore, I am making a mini-course that follows this philosophy.</description>
