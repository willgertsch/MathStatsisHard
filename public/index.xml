      <description>Consider the mixed effects model \[ Y | \gamma \sim N(X\beta + Z\gamma, \sigma^2 I_n) \] where \[ \gamma \sim N(0_q, \Sigma) \] The posterior distribution of the random effect \(\gamma | Y\) is multivariate normal. This means that the two quadratic forms in \(f(Y|\gamma)f(\gamma)\) have to be combined into one. This is a difficult algebra problem which involves an analogue for completing the square for matrices.
The best resource I found for the multivariate case of completing the square is this article</description>

      <description>The negative binomial distribution models the number of failures until \(r\) successes given success probability \(p\). Its PMF is \[ P(X = k|r,p) = {k + r -1\choose k}(1-p)^kp^r \]
for \(k = 0, 1, \dots\), $ r &amp;gt; 0$, and \(0 &amp;lt; p &amp;lt; 1\).
There are two ways to compute the expected value and variance. The first is the direct method and the second uses the fact that the negative binomial distribution is part of the exponential family if \(r\) is given.</description>
