Consider the mixed effects model
$$
Y | \gamma \sim N(X\beta + Z\gamma, \sigma^2 I_n)
$$
where
$$
\gamma \sim N(0_q, \Sigma)
$$
The posterior distribution of the random effect $\gamma | Y$ is multivariate normal. This means that the two quadratic forms in $f(Y|\gamma)f(\gamma)$ have to be combined into one. This is a difficult algebra problem which involves an analogue for completing the square for matrices.

The best resource I found for the multivariate case of completing the square is this [article](https://learnbayes.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77:completesquare&catid=83:reference&Itemid=479)

I recommend working through the example and then writing out the general steps to really understand the process.
