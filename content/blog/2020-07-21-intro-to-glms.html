<p>I took a course in generalized linear models in my first year of graduate school, but I was never happy with the organization of the material in our lecture slides or in the books I have read on the subject. I feel that introducing the general theory as early as possible is helpful in understanding the many, many models that come up in a a course on GLMs. Therefore, I am making a mini-course that follows this philosophy.</p>
<p>This is going to be a series of posts and I am expecting the outline to be something like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Logistic regression</p></li>
<li><p>General GLM theory</p></li>
<li><p>Inference</p></li>
<li><p>Model fitting</p></li>
<li><p>An overview of the specific details for popular GLMs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite books (the ones I’ll be referencing) on GLMs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Extending the Linear Model with R” by Faraway</li>
<li>“An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models” by Dobson</li>
<li>Wikipedia (no really, the GLM article is great)</li>
</ul>
